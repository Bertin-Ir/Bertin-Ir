## Projects
- 🔗 **[Library Catalog Management System](https://github.com/Bertin-Ir/lcms)**: A C++ application for organizing and managing book collections using hierarchical categories. It features custom data structures and algorithms for efficient cataloging, all accessible through an intuitive command-line interface.
- 🔗 **[Translator: Multilingual Dictionary](https://github.com/Bertin-Ir/Translator)**: A multilingual dictionary powered by a custom hash table with quadratic probing, it enables ultra-fast lookups and scalable memory use for large datasets.
- 🔗 **[SMart Drive Alert System](https://github.com/Bertin-Ir/SmartDriveAlertSystem)**: This project aims to enhance road safety by monitoring drivers' stress, fatigue, and distractions. Using the Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic and Pulse sensor,
  the system tracks heart rate variability (HRV) to assess the driver's mental and physical state. The system provides real-time alerts, helping to reduce the risk of accidents caused by driver stress and distractions.
- 🔗 **[Tesla Coil Simulator](https://github.com/Bertin-Ir/Tesla_coil_Simulator)**: This software simulates the behavior of a Tesla Coil system over a specified time span using C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach.
