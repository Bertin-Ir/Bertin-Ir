- 📫 How to reach me: [email me](iradukundabertin01@gmail.com)

## Skills
- 🖥️ **Programming Languages**: C, C++, Python, MATLAB
- 🚀 **Interests**: Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Development

## Projects
- 🔗 **[SMart Drive Alert System](https://github.com/Bertin-Ir/SmartDriveAlertSystem)**: This project aims to enhance road safety by monitoring drivers' stress, fatigue, and distractions. Using the Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic and Pulse sensor,
  the system tracks heart rate variability (HRV) to assess the driver's mental and physical state. The system provides real-time alerts, helping to reduce the risk of accidents caused by driver stress and distractions.
- 🔗 **[Tesla Coil Simulator](https://github.com/Bertin-Ir/SmartDriveAlertSystem)**: This software simulates the behavior of a Tesla Coil system over a specified time span. The interactions between its components, including the power supply, transformer, spark gap, capacitor, and coils, are modeled using mathematical principles and numerical methods. The results are saved to files for analysis, allowing for an in-depth understanding of the system dynamics.
